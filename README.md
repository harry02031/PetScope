# PetScope
A database project that intends to capture the information of missing pets, stray pets and sheltered pets available for adoption with its respective information such as gender, age, breed, owner, etc. This project was completed in a group of three for CPSC 304: Introduction to Relational Databases. There are two types of users in this project. Ordinary registrants; users who can be pet owners, or simply bystanders who search for and report missing pets. These users have the ability to perform most operations except for registering sheltered animals or granting adoption requests. The other users are Adoption agencies which are able to insert and update data for sheltered pets. They also are able to accept or reject adoption applications for pets in this category.
